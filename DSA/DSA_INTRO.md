# Data Structures and Algorithms

This sections gathers lecture notes form the DD1338 course at KTH and the book "Introduction to algorithms 4th edition".

## ADT - Abstract Data Types
ADT are model, not an actual implementation or piece of code. This model describe the behavior of any type of data. One can use this ADT to implement data structures capable of storing data.

| Sets  | Lists  |  Tree/Graph  |  Map  |
| ----- |------- | ------------ | ----- |
|Collection of unique elements where order do not matter| Sequence of values where order matter and allows duplicates | Nodes with relations beetween each other | Group of records with a key and a value mapped to that key |

These 3 basic ADT do not exist by themselves in programming languages. One must implement them or use other peoples' implementation.
