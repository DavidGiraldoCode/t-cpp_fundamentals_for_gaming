# How to run these programs.

All the sketches in this repo run using the terminal. Anyone reading this is free to use any other method, but for the sake of simplicity and to keep it framework and IDE agnostic, you may use the following steps:

```bash
cd s-folder_name
cd source
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o myProgram && ./myProgram
```

## In the backlog:
[ ] Create a Makefile to simplify the linking of libraries for future more complex programs.
